active angel investors in developer tools!

  > I irregularly angel invest small checks ($2500-$5000) of my own money in early-stage startups I'm excited about. Think of me as an advisor with skin in the game — I love helping with tricky, ambiguous problems, providing access to my network and audience, or even just lending an ear to founders building exciting new things.

  > I’m a technologist. I studied CS at MIT and still write code. When I invest, I specifically look for technical founders building dev tools, API platforms, and “unloved” workflow cloud SaaS. I founded both Nylas and WorkOS and worked at Dropbox so this is an area I know well. My typical check size is around $100k but I can flex and get creative for bigger rounds too. If I invest, I will offer introductions to other investors I know (and like). This can help fill out a larger round. [more here](https://twitter.com/grinich/status/1357103610421673984?s=20)

  > I enjoy helping dev tool creators build top-notch teams, figure out go-to-market, and meet other great investors. I've been working on developer tools for most of the past decade as CTO and co-founder of [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com). I host a [podcast](https://about.sourcegraph.com/podcast/) featuring creators of dev tools--if you've built something you'd love to share with the developer world, I'd love to have you on the show!
